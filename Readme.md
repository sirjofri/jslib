# jslib

this will become my personal collection of auxiliary javascript functions. It doesn't have a proper name and it doesn't need a proper name.

## Usage

Just clone (or create a submodule) the repository to a subfolder of your project (or elsewhere) and link the files you want `<script src="blablabla"></script>`.

For more information see the wiki pages.

## License

Do with it whatever you want. Don't blame me if your computer crashes or IE kills your horse and you must walk to work tomorrow.
